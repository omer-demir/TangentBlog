### Acceptance Tests

Typically E2E tests. Incude UI. Are far floer and more brittle than unit tests.

### Performance Tests

Verify acceptale performance for key operations. May target individual core and infra class. Frequently exercise full stack UI included

### Load Tests

Most resource intensive test.
